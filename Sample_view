That said, this kit is great!  Three months after and I have zero regards. Honey Amber Lacquer is a beautiful looking set of drums. And to me, they sound great. Included hardware quality is impressive. Nothing about about the hardware seems flimsy. Wife (who is going to learn drums, as well) likes the look enough that she insisted they go in the living room instead of the spare bedroom as I had planned.<br /><br />I got what I expected and what was in the description; five drums, bass drum pedal, high hat stand, and two cymbal stands. The kit does not include a drum throne, and it does not include cymbals. Some concerns from other reviews where they only got five drums and no hardware. I believe those were all orders from Sam Ash Music; they were lowest price, but checking samash dot com, I could see that the price for Pearl Export EXL drum shell kit (drums only, no hardware) at the Sam Ash website was same as what was shown on Amazon as drums + hardware. And a few review were clear that Sam Ash told them after the fact they were ONLY providing a drum shell kit. So I stayed away from the drums listed from Sam Ash and got my drums direct from Amazon<br /><br />If just starting out, for the cymbals I would suggest Wuhan WUTBSU Western Style Cymbal Set with Cymbal Bag.  Others pointed me to them, as best value in the $200-$350 range. [[ASIN:B0002D0HO4 Wuhan WUTBSU Western Style Cymbal Set with Cymbal Bag]]<br /><br />You will have to install heads on the bass drum, and set up the hardware, but that's all. Other drums are ready to go. I got a DrumDial to tune the kit with, only to find it wasn't really necessary; toms were tuned perfectly from the factory, snare was a little low, but no enough to count. A help for anyone unpacking and setting up is on Youtube.  Look for &#34;Pearl Drums Export Kit Set Up (Inside Music) with Adrian Violi&#34;.  Just don't worry about tuning every drum head as described in the video unless it sounds really off, it may be fine from the factory.<br /><br />Lastly, it's common to get a bit of a resonant effect in the drums with the quality of drumheads.  SlapKlatz damper gel is a very quick fix for that.

That said, this kit is great!  Three months after and I have zero regards. Honey Amber Lacquer is a beautiful looking set of drums. And to me, they sound great. Included hardware quality is impressive. Nothing about about the hardware seems flimsy. Wife (who is going to learn drums, as well) likes the look enough that she insisted they go in the living room instead of the spare bedroom as I had planned.<br /><br />I got what I expected and what was in the description; five drums, bass drum pedal, high hat stand, and two cymbal stands. The kit does not include a drum throne, and it does not include cymbals. Some concerns from other reviews where they only got five drums and no hardware. I believe those were all orders from Sam Ash Music; they were lowest price, but checking samash dot com, I could see that the price for Pearl Export EXL drum shell kit (drums only, no hardware) at the Sam Ash website was same as what was shown on Amazon as drums + hardware. And a few review were clear that Sam Ash told them after the fact they were ONLY providing a drum shell kit. So I stayed away from the drums listed from Sam Ash and got my drums direct from Amazon<br /><br />If just starting out, for the cymbals I would suggest Wuhan WUTBSU Western Style Cymbal Set with Cymbal Bag.  Others pointed me to them, as best value in the $200-$350 range. [[ASIN:B0002D0HO4 Wuhan WUTBSU Western Style Cymbal Set with Cymbal Bag]]<br /><br />You will have to install heads on the bass drum, and set up the hardware, but that's all. Other drums are ready to go. I got a DrumDial to tune the kit with, only to find it wasn't really necessary; toms were tuned perfectly from the factory, snare was a little low, but no enough to count. A help for anyone unpacking and setting up is on Youtube.  Look for &#34;Pearl Drums Export Kit Set Up (Inside Music) with Adrian Violi&#34;.  Just don't worry about tuning every drum head as described in the video unless it sounds really off, it may be fine from the factory.<br /><br />Lastly, it's common to get a bit of a resonant effect in the drums with the quality of drumheads.  SlapKlatz damper gel is a very quick fix for that.

That said, this kit is great!  Three months after and I have zero regards. Honey Amber Lacquer is a beautiful looking set of drums. And to me, they sound great. Included hardware quality is impressive. Nothing about about the hardware seems flimsy. Wife (who is going to learn drums, as well) likes the look enough that she insisted they go in the living room instead of the spare bedroom as I had planned.<br /><br />I got what I expected and what was in the description; five drums, bass drum pedal, high hat stand, and two cymbal stands. The kit does not include a drum throne, and it does not include cymbals. Some concerns from other reviews where they only got five drums and no hardware. I believe those were all orders from Sam Ash Music; they were lowest price, but checking samash dot com, I could see that the price for Pearl Export EXL drum shell kit (drums only, no hardware) at the Sam Ash website was same as what was shown on Amazon as drums + hardware. And a few review were clear that Sam Ash told them after the fact they were ONLY providing a drum shell kit. So I stayed away from the drums listed from Sam Ash and got my drums direct from Amazon<br /><br />If just starting out, for the cymbals I would suggest Wuhan WUTBSU Western Style Cymbal Set with Cymbal Bag.  Others pointed me to them, as best value in the $200-$350 range. [[ASIN:B0002D0HO4 Wuhan WUTBSU Western Style Cymbal Set with Cymbal Bag]]<br /><br />You will have to install heads on the bass drum, and set up the hardware, but that's all. Other drums are ready to go. I got a DrumDial to tune the kit with, only to find it wasn't really necessary; toms were tuned perfectly from the factory, snare was a little low, but no enough to count. A help for anyone unpacking and setting up is on Youtube.  Look for &#34;Pearl Drums Export Kit Set Up (Inside Music) with Adrian Violi&#34;.  Just don't worry about tuning every drum head as described in the video unless it sounds really off, it may be fine from the factory.<br /><br />Lastly, it's common to get a bit of a resonant effect in the drums with the quality of drumheads.  SlapKlatz damper gel is a very quick fix for that.
